            <p>Our Ecommerce websites are built to connect shoppers to products or services for trading online. On the most basic level, they provide everything we need for online shopping. They work like this:
                A customer finds the website, then buys goods and services. When they’ve decided they’re done online shopping, they move to the checkout phase.
                Following the website’s checkout process, the buyer provides the necessary payment and shipping information.</p>
